{"name":"Vagrant Examples","tagline":"Understand Vagrant through some simple examples","body":"## Welcome to Vagrant Examples\r\nVagrant examples is meant help someone new to Vagrant better understand what Vagrant is and what its features are.\r\n\r\n## What is Vagrant\r\nVagrant is a tool that interacts with a VM provider, like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/) to create and configure VMs, like configuring network adapters to use [NAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) or [Bridged](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_(networking)). It then interacts with the newly created VM to provision the VM, like setting the hostname and IP address as well as installing software on the VM. Vagrant does this in an automated way and is meant to be version controlled along side source code.\r\n\r\n## What Vagrant is not\r\nVagrant is not a VM provider. It just interacts with a VM provider through that provider's APIs.\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n\r\n#### Developer Environment\r\nVagrant can be used to create a developer environment to easily create the necessary build tools so that all developers have a consistent environment.\r\n\r\n#### Play with Technology\r\nVagrant can be used to play with interesting software, like [nginx](http://nginx.org/) or the [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/elk-stack-devops-environment). You can play with the software without having to worry about impacting your developer machine.\r\n\r\n#### Simulate environments\r\nVagrant can be used to simulate distributed environments. You can install a 3-node database cluster and simulate machines going up and down or partition machines from each other.\r\n\r\n## Still Interested?
